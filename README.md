## App Description: 
- The K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that attempts to find the innate clustering behavior of its training data. It does so by attempting to partition n feature vectors into k clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares, that is, finding a clustering where the distance of each feature vector to its clusterâ€™s center is minimized.

## Dataset:
- A dataset containing information regarding different chemical content of wine will be used. The task is to classify
the points in wine.csv. You need to ask the user two columns of data which will be used to classify the points into k
clusters. The number of clusters must also be asked to the user.
